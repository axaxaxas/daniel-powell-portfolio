Synthsound is a simple Python framework for writing audio synthesis software.
Synthsound allows any function fully defined on the positive reals to be used
to generate audio.

Audiopack is a Python extension written in C that provides an interface for
packaging Python objects into raw audio frames that can be written to a
sound card.

Synthsound and Audiopack require ALSA and the Python ALSA library.

Install Audiopack under Linux with:

sudo python setup.py install

Synthsound is not packaged into a module, but can be used by importing
synthsound.py.

example.py provides a simple demonstration of how synthsound.py can be used.
